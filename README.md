# Introduction
Welcome to [MyPCH project](https://www.mypch.eu) framework.

This repository contains components to demonstrate **integration** of the framework Semantic Container (SC) (https://github.com/sem-con) with Tidepool software (TP) (https://github.com/tidepool-org) to collect, get insights and share self-monitoring health data from diabetes devices in the diabetes ecosystem.  

The repository also shows how to establish a **proxy** that demo how other services like SC components can be integrated into the TP platform. The service can integrate with the platform either directly by extenting the proxy itself or indirectly by using the API of the proxy in their integration of the service.
