# Proxy
This demonstration shows how to establish a **proxy** end-2-end demo for the MyPCH project. 

It will describe and demo how components from Semantic Container (SC) can be integrated into the Tidepool platform (TP).

The proxy is a data integration to Tidepool as a proxy to handle integration between TP uploader, SC-features and a backend as Tidepool platform. In the code it is marked where it is possible to make a SC-hook to demonstrate how features from an extended SC-framework can enhance PwD diabetes data with features like watermarking, anonymization, provenance and features to make a granular consent by use of usages policy.  

We have defined a concept of a health data store (HDS) to merit higher protection for sensitive data as health data. The HDS is inspired by similar examples using human-centric MyData principles in https://github.com/okffi/mydata#9---give-me-some-examples.
